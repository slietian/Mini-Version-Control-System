# 🗂️ Mini Version Control System (Git-like)

A **lightweight Git-inspired version control system** built using **Python**, designed to understand how **Git works internally** by implementing core version control concepts from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **command-line based version control system** that mimics the basic functionality of **Git**.  
It allows users to track files, create commits, and maintain a simple commit history using **file system operations and hashing**.

The goal of this project is to gain a **deep understanding of Git internals**, such as how Git stores objects, manages commits, and tracks file changes.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Initialize a repository (`init`)  
✅ Track files for versioning (`add`)  
✅ Create commits with messages (`commit`)  
✅ View commit history (`log`)  
✅ Stores objects using **hashing**  
✅ Uses **directory-based object storage**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **File System Operations**
- **Hashing (SHA-1)**
- **Command Line Interface**
- **Git Internals Concepts**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Initializes a hidden directory to store repository data  
- Tracks file changes by calculating **hash values**  
- Stores file snapshots as objects in structured directories  
- Maintains commit history using metadata files  
- Mimics how Git internally manages blobs, trees, and commits  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Strong understanding of **Git internals**
- Hands-on experience with **file handling and hashing**
- Knowledge of **version control system design**
- Improved **backend and system-level programming skills**
- Clear understanding of how tools like **Git** work internally

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Implement branching and merging
- Add file diff functionality
- Improve error handling
- Support remote repositories (push/pull)
